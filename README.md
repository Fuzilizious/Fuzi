# Master Thesis: Investigating the role of snow stratigraphy and water transport schemes in modelling wet-snow instability.

Python Codes used for my Master Thesis. 
A bit hardcoded but it should be possible to recreate ;)

- MySnowpack.py: Main Program to run SNOWPACK
- SnowTools.py: collection of functions used for MySnowpack.py and SnowPlot.py
- sno.py: functions to adjust *.sno files
- pro2netcdf.py: merge *.pro files into *.nc file for better plotting
- SnowPlot.py: Different Plots for SNOWPACK output
